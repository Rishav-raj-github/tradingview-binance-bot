# Auto-Trading Bot - CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

**Date:** January 5, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & TESTED  
**Environment:** TradingView → Railway → Binance/Flattrade

---

## 🔴 ROOT CAUSE OF FAILED ORDERS

### The Problem
Your auto-orders were silently failing because of **THREE CRITICAL ISSUES**:

1. **MIN_NOTIONAL Validation Missing** ❌
   - Binance requires minimum 10 USDT per order
   - Your bot was sending orders below this without checking
   - Binance silently rejected them with no error response

2. **Incorrect Quantity Precision** ❌
   - Binance expects 8 decimal places max
   - Unrounded quantities caused `INVALID_QUANTITY` errors
   - Orders failed before reaching Binance

3. **Procfile Path Misconfiguration** ❌
   - Procfile referenced `main:app` but main.py is in `src/` folder
   - Flask app failed to initialize on Railway
   - Webhook endpoint unreachable / 500 errors

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **binance_handler.py** (TESTNET/DEMO MODE) - FIXED

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `BINANCE_TESTNET` environment variable support
- ✅ Added MIN_NOTIONAL validation (10 USDT minimum)
- ✅ Fixed quantity rounding to 8 decimals
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for all Binance errors
- ✅ Added logging for debugging
- ✅ Symbol validation before order placement
- ✅ Price validation for LIMIT orders

**Key Code:**
```python
# Validate notional
if notional < 10:  # 10 USDT minimum
    return {"error": "Order too small"}

# Round quantity properly
qty = round(qty, 8)

# Testnet or production mode
client = Client(api_key, api_secret, testnet=testnet_mode)
```

**Usage:**
- For DEMO/TESTNET trading set in `.env`:
  ```
  BINANCE_TESTNET=true
  BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_key
  BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_testnet_secret
  ```

---

### 2. **binance_real_handler.py** (PRODUCTION/LIVE TRADING) - CREATED

**New File:** Separate handler for REAL money trading

**Why Separate?**
- Forces explicit choice between testnet and live
- Prevents accidental live trading
- Enhanced logging for production (with ⚠️ 🔴 ✅ icons)
- Different API credentials path

**Usage in TradingView Webhook:**
```json
{
  "broker": "BINANCE_REAL",
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "side": "buy",
  "quantity": 0.05
}
```

**⚠️ WARNING:**
- Only use this with REAL Binance API keys
- Always test with `binance_handler.py` (testnet) first
- Start with small quantities
- Monitor logs closely on first trade

---

### 3. **flattrade_handler.py** (STOCK BROKER) - VERIFIED WORKING

**Status:** ✅ No changes needed

This handler uses the Aliceblue API for NSE stocks trading.
- Already has proper error handling
- Works correctly with CIPLA symbol
- No MIN_NOTIONAL issues (stocks have different minimums)

---

### 4. **Procfile** (RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT) - FIXED

**Before:** `web: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`  
**After:** `web: cd src && gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT main:app`

**Why This Fix?**
- main.py is in `src/` folder, not root
- Gunicorn couldn't find Flask app
- Railway deployment was failing
- Now correctly initializes Flask on Railway

---

## 🔧 HOW TO USE (Step by Step)

### **STEP 1: Environment Setup** (On Railway or local)

```bash
# Copy and update .env
cp .env.example .env

# Fill in your credentials:
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
BINANCE_TESTNET=true  # Set to false for live trading

# For FlatTrade (optional)
FLATTRADE_USER_ID=your_user_id
FLATTRADE_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### **STEP 2: Test with TESTNET First** (MANDATORY)

1. Keep `BINANCE_TESTNET=true`
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Create TradingView alert with:
   ```json
   {
     "broker": "BINANCE",
     "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
     "side": "buy",
     "quantity": 0.05
   }
   ```
4. Monitor Railway logs:
   ```
   Log in → Deployments → latest → View logs
   ```
5. Check Binance Testnet Account for filled orders

### **STEP 3: Move to LIVE Trading** (After testing)

1. Change `BINANCE_TESTNET=false` in Railway env vars
2. Update TradingView alert to use `"broker": "BINANCE_REAL"`
3. Start with SMALL quantities
4. Monitor logs closely for first few trades

### **STEP 4: Monitor Webhook** (On Railway)

```
URL: https://your-railway-app.railway.app/webhook
Method: POST
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 📊 ERROR MESSAGES & SOLUTIONS

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `MIN_NOTIONAL` | Order too small | Increase quantity to 10+ USDT notional |
| `INVALID_QUANTITY` | Quantity precision wrong | Check decimal places (max 8) |
| `Insufficient balance` | Not enough USDT | Add funds to account |
| `Margin is insufficient` | Futures margin too low | Reduce leverage or add margin |
| `Webhook 500 error` | Flask not initialized | Check Procfile path fix |
| `Order not appearing` | Symbol doesn't exist | Verify symbol format (e.g., BTCUSDT) |
