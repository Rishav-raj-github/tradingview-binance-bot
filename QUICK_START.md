## ✅ What You Have (Already Done)

## 🚀 5-MINUTE SETUP

### STEP 1: Get Your Webhook URL (Copy This)

```
https://market_feed-webhook-bot-production-bf38.up.railway.app/webhook
```

### STEP 2: Go to MarketFeed → Chart → Alert

1. Open your execution chart in MarketFeed
2. Click: **Alert** (bell icon)
3. Set your condition (e.g., "Close > Open")
4. Click **Create Alert**

### STEP 3: Configure the Alert Action

In the alert dialog:

1. **Notification type**: Choose **Webhook URL**
2. **URL**: Paste the webhook URL above
3. **Message** (most important part):

```json
{
    "broker": "DIGITAL_ASSET",
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "side": "buy",
    "quantity": 0.001,
    "type": "MARKET"
}
```

4. Click **Create**

### STEP 4: Wait for Your Chart Condition

When the chart triggers (e.g., candle closes above resistance):
- ✅ MarketFeed fires alert automatically
- ✅ Webhook message sent to Railway
- ✅ Order placed on DigitalAsset testnet
- ✅ Within 10 seconds: Order visible in your account

### STEP 5: Verify in DigitalAsset

**Check Testnet** (free demo):
1. Go to: https://testnet.binance.vision
2. Login with your DigitalAsset testnet account
3. Go to: **Futures → Order History**
4. Find your **BTCUSDT** order
5. Status: **FILLED** ✅

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Choose Your Mode

### **TESTNET MODE** (Recommended First)
- No real money
- Perfect for testing
- Orders placed on: https://testnet.binance.vision
- Status: **ALREADY ENABLED**

### **LIVE MODE** (Real Money)
When you're ready:

1. Go to: https://railway.com/project/.../variables
2. Find: `BINANCE_TESTNET`
3. Change: `true` → `false`
4. Redeploy

**⚠️ WARNING: This will use REAL MONEY. Start with 0.001 BTC!**
